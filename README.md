# LIQID Front End test

This test is about working with React Native to produce a web app as well as a native mobile app (IOS/Android).
Please don't write HTML and use the React Native components like `View` and `Text` to build your solution. It compiles later to html with webpack and react-native-web. Have fun :)

This app compiles to ios, android and web using React native and React native web.
for this test please choose one of ios or android that you'll want to support - no need for both.
For ios you might need Xcode and for android you might need Android Studio and JDK.
Please contact us with any questions or problems you might incounter.

## Task
- Build a contacts app with a contact list and a detailed contact view
- implement the design in the pictures (or make it better ðŸ¤¨)

### Contact List page
- The contacts item list data should come from the jsonplaceholder endpoint`https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users`.
- When clicked the user should be shown the detailed contact view page with all the contact's details in the design.
- The contact list should be the default home page
- Each item should show the `name` of the contact.
- On `desktop` the items and the full detailed view should be side by side
- On `ios/android/web-mobile` the list and the full view should show separately with a return/back/close button to return the user to the list

### Detailed contact page
- The page should show the contact's details as per the design

- Create tests for all your components and reducers
- add images to each contact
- When clicking on the phone number the user should be redirected to the phone app (to call the number)
- When clicking on the website the user should be redirected (in a new tab) to the website of the contact
- Support both ios and android
